            <p className="mb-5 text-2xl font-light">Founded in 2023 by two visionary students who identified the absence of a Model United Nations (MUN) club within Gitam, GMUN was conceived with the overarching mission of disseminating the cultural and professional importance of MUN. Our primary objective is to cultivate adept future leaders well-versed in Diplomacy and International Relations.</p>

            <p className="mb-5 text-2xl font-light">Endorsed by the Directorate of Student Life, GMUN stands as a testament to the commitment to nurturing a community that embraces diplomatic discourse. At present, the initiative is led by a dedicated team comprising over 50 members, poised for expansion in the foreseeable future.</p>

            <p className="mb-5 text-2xl font-light">Embracing the maxim, "Aim for the stars and you'll reach the sky," GMUN is dedicated to fostering an environment that encourages ambition, excellence, and the pursuit of knowledge in the realm of international affairs. Join us on this journey as we collectively strive for academic and diplomatic excellence.</p>
